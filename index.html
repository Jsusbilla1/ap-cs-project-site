      <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/721636393/">Scratch Maze</a></p>
      <p>This is the scratch game that I created over the summer, which is just a girl asking if you want to play a
        game. Within the game you are playing a maze and then retrieve the apple game until you reach the requirement of
        points you need to win the game.My problem with making the game was I had 0 idea how to use scratch because I
        never really coded with it but within some practice of learning the blocks watching videos etc. I learned how to
        make my game the best I could to my ability.</p>

      <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/721636393/">Drawing project</a></p>
      <p>Here is a project that I created with my partner in AP csp, even though it is not yet finished and the project isnâ€™t yet what it is supposed to be I think that the design it makes so far is pretty cool. A problem I found with this project is it is a little more complicated that scratch so it takes a little bit of time to get used to learning the new things on snap.</p>
